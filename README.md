# Banknote-Authentication
Implement popular classification algorithms to differentiate counterfeit from legitimate banknotes accurately.

1. **Problem Statement:**
   - Despite increased internet accessibility, physical currency (banknotes) remains widely used.
   - Counterfeit banknotes pose a challenge due to advanced printing technology.
   - Differentiating between legitimate and counterfeit notes manually is nearly impossible.

2. **Project Aim:**
   - Use data extracted from banknote images to classify them as legitimate or counterfeit.
   - Employ classification algorithms: Decision Tree, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
   - Compare and display accuracy for each algorithm.

3. **Data Source:**
   - Used the banknote authentication dataset.
   - Extracted features from banknote images using wavelet transform.

4. **Classification Algorithms:**
   - Decision Tree: Highest accuracy (99.27%).
   - KNN (k = 3 and k = 5).
   - Random Forest.
   - SVM: Lowest accuracy (41.82%).

5. **Objective:**
   - Implement popular classification algorithms to differentiate counterfeit from legitimate banknotes accurately.
